# Logo for JS

The purpose of this project is to provide an east environment to teach by daughter how to program using JavaScript.

The logo.js file contains Logo like functions and keeps track of the state of the application.

program.js is where my daughter would write her programs.  This file must have a start() function that is the entry point for the program.

index.html is the HTML page that shows the output of the program.  Its runs a single function in batch mode.
